          <Block title="Who am I?">
            A simple nerd from Kenya who loves to code! I love talking and researching about physics. I love listening
            to music. I love movies and tv shows. I love pretty much all the nerdy things, what I would refer to as <span
              >nerdology</span
            >. I believe in doing things with passion and with all your heart, or not at all! It's like that cool Bill
            Skarsg√•rd line from John Wick, "How you do anything, is how you do everything"

          <Block title="What do I do?">
            I have been programming for almost 3 years now and it's what I do with majority of my time. I started out as
            a web developer, playing around with Javascript frameworks like react, vue & angular, found my way into
            Node.js and backend development, then I heard somewhere about this cool language called Rust, picked up
            python and golang along the way... and some more other stuff and now I'm a very passionate and proficient
            developer. From web development with pretty much any framework, to cross platform app development with
            Flutter and React Native, to machine learning, I know a thing or two about programming.

          <Block title="My love for physics">
            For as long as I can remember, I have always had this deep passion for physics. It's very elegant and
            beautiful. I am particularly intrigued by the works of figures like Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Einstein...
            in short, anything pertaining to Gravity, or a quantum theory of gravity. I do some physics research now and
            then for a paper I'm working on and as for my subscription when it comes to quantum mechanics
            interpretations, I would have to choose Pilot Wave theory, or moreso, a modified version of it.

          <Block title="Music, medicine for the soul">
            From Bon Jovi to The Weeknd, I like all sorts of music. I've played around with FL Studio and other DAWs,
            but nothing that serious, maybe someday. I'm a hardcore MCU fan and like other stuff such as GOT, Stranger
            things, HIMYM. Did I say like? I meant obsessed with them. These are some of the stuff I do in my leisure
            alongside playing around with 3D sofware mostly Blender, Houdini and Nuke.

          <Block title="What am I upto?">
            An year and a half into my undergradute engineering course, I realized that's not what I really wanted to do
            with my life and so I dropped out! Why, you ask ? Coz my heart was somewhere else. I had already been
            programming for a while and so basically just dedicated 100% of my time to it. Today, I work at a very cool
            startup called <a class="underline" href="https://jumba.com">Jumba</a>, as a fullstack software developer
            helping to build and ship their software needs. I'm also a big fan of open source and occassionally work on
            some projects. Besides that, I'm building other cool stuff such as <a
