            I'm from Kenya and I am a nerd! I love to code. I love talking and researching about physics. I love
            listening to music. I love movies and tv shows. I love pretty much all the nerdy things, what I would refer
            to as <span>nerdology</span>

            I have been programming for almost 3 years now and it's what I do with majority of my time. I started out as
            a web developer, playing around with Javascript frameworks like react, vue & angular, found my way into
            Node.js and backend development, then I heard somewhere about this cool language called Rust, picked up
            python and golang along the way... and some more other stuff and now I'm a very passionate and proficient
            developer. From web development with pretty much any framework, to cross platform app development with
            Flutter and React Native, to machine learning, I know a thing or two about programming.
          </p>

            For as long as I can remember, I have always had this deep passion for physics. It's very elegant and
            beautiful. I am particularly intrigued by the works of figures like Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Einstein...
            in short, anything pertaining to Gravity, or a quantum theory of gravity. I do some physics research now and
            then for a paper I'm working on and as for my subscription when it comes to quantum mechanics
            interpretations, I would have to choose Pilot Wave theory, or moreso, a modified version of it.

            From Bon Jovi to The Weeknd, I like all sorts of music. I've played around with FL Studio and other DAWs,
            but nothing that serious, maybe someday. I'm a hardcore MCU fan and like other stuff such as GOT, Stranger
            things, HIMYM. Did I say like? I meant obsessed with them. These are some of the stuff I do in my leisure
            alongside playing around with 3D sofware mostly Blender, Houdini and Nuke.

            Today, I’m the founder of a small startup called Digitalfarmer, where we’re working on creating
            technological solutions to help farmers around Africa. I'm also working on other projects such as Fefa
            Academy: a free online academy, Backframe: a simple BaaS solution, and much more.
