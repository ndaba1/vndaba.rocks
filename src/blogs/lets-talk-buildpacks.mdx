excerpt: If you've ever deployed an app to heroku you know how seamless the process is. Although your deployed app will run in a container, you don't actually define any Dockerfiles yourself. Heroku analyzes your app and build a container from it. This is where buildpacks come in

Buildpacks are a concept that have been around for a while now. They make your deployment process less of a hassle without you even knowing that they do so. Docker containers are the easiest way to deploy an app but not everyone wants/knows how to create a Dockerfile to containerize their apps. Thats where buildpacks come in.
